// The solver's core: given a run of strokes that missed the dictionary, find the word (or the
// words and suffixes, joined) it most likely meant.
//
// This file is self-contained on purpose. lyk compiles it natively as `src/rules/solve/core.rs`
// (for `resolve`, `lookup`, the eval and the site data) and the plugin generator splices it,
// unchanged, into the keymux plugin's source: one decoder, never two copies that can drift. So:
// no `crate::`/`super::` paths, no dependencies outside `std`, no inner attributes.
//
// How it works (see `site/reference/fallback.json` for the rules a typist needs):
//
// - Every stroke is read back into *every* run of sounds its keys can write: each way to cover
//   the left bank with onset chords, the vowel keys as any vowel they write (heard, or as the
//   word spells it), each way to cover the right bank with coda chords, the star as a sound or
//   as a marker. Those readings form a small tree of sound tokens per stroke.
// - The lexicon is a trie over every word's pronunciation (and over a reading of its spelling),
//   with each vowel edge knowing which vowel letters spell it in that word.
// - A beam of trie positions is pushed through each stroke's tokens: a token that matches an edge
//   costs nothing, a sound the word has that the strokes skipped costs by what it is (an
//   unstressed vowel almost nothing, a stressed one a lot), a sound the strokes have that the
//   word does not costs more. At each stroke boundary a position that ends a word may emit that
//   word (costing more the rarer it is) and start the next piece. A suffix chord and a run of
//   strokes that is exactly a known word's outline are exact pieces.
// - The word typed just before the run (keymux's `context`), when there is one, re-ranks the
//   readings by how often each one's first word follows it on the web ([`previous_word`],
//   [`CONTEXT_WEIGHT_TENTHS`]).
// - The cheapest way through the whole run wins. Every loop is bounded by the run's length and
//   the beam's width: there is no input that makes it slow.
